          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
          >Karamvir Singh</a

        problem.
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the projects I'm working on included set of videos embeded in a
        React app, which needed to be modified by my client on a regular basis.
        The issue, however, was that regular video urls don't work in iframe
        tags. Needless to say, my client wasn't too keen on having to dig
        thought the embed code provided by youtube or vimeo, copy the embed url
        from the supplied iframe tags, and then paste it into the appropriate
        area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, one solution would be to use the fantastic
        <a href="https://oembed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
          >oEmbed api</a
        >. However, this solution wasn't satisfactory, since using the oEmbed
        api resulted in a pretty substantial case of overfetching. oEmbed's api
        respose not only contains a lot of meta-data about the video in
        question, it also returns a full iframe tag with some options and
        styling enabled by default. Moreover, since oEmbed returns a complete
        iframe tag, I would have to parse throgh that to find the actual embed
        url I was looking for, which didn't appeal to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since, my React component was already setup such that the only thing
        that needed to be added to the iframe was the embed url. I wrote this
        simple api that accepts a regular youtube or vimeo url, and returns a
        valid embed url that can be neatly plugged into my React iframe
        component that has already been setup with custom rules and styling
        that, to me, are easier to work with than the iframe tags supplied by
        oEmbed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This api was made using
        <a href="https://feathersjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
          >FeathersJS</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://expressjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
          >ExpressJS</a
        >, two excellent libraries for creating microservice apis and much more.
        The code for this api is freely avialable in this
        <a
          href="https://github.com/karamvirsingh98/url-to-embed"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
          >GitHub repository</a
        >. This project also owes a great deal to these two StackOverflow posts
        regarding the best way to go about deconstructing
